      <p>
        You really jumped the gun on that one. You've decided to attack the enemies with very few allies by your side. The only reason you're still alive is that the rival gangs now know that you're an easy target. Your surplus of supplies has been stolen and now you cannot take care of your members. Unfortunately, this will surely spell disaster for your clan. Your selfish actions have resulted in the destruction of your clan.
