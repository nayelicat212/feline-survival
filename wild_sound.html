        Many cats in your clan are out gathering supplies from a nearby forest. You and a few of your members are supposed to be on alert until they return. When everything seems a bit too quiet, you hear some noises coming from outside the warehouse. It does not sound like your members returning. Maybe it's nothing. You can lock up the warehouse just to be on the safe side. But maybe the sounds are worth investigatingâ€¦
