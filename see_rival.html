      <p>
        Did curiosity kill the cat? You've decided to look outside to investigate the strange noises. Unfortunately, you've stumbled upon what seems to be a rival gang sneaking up on your warehouse. Sometimes these gangs are unorganized and rely on the element of surprise. You might be able to win this battle if you attack first. If you run, you might be able to find your scavenging members, but it is risky. Maybe you can de-escalate the situation by other meansâ€¦
