      <p>
        Maybe the sight of the rival cat gang was too much for you. In any case, you've decided to run. Maybe you thought you could get away in time. Fate would have it another way. The rival cat gang already had members surrounding the warehouse and now you have nowhere to go. As you're hanging from a rusty pipe, clinging for your life, you have an epiphany. Maybe you shouldn't run from your problems. Oh well. Maybe you'll do better with one of your eight other lives.
