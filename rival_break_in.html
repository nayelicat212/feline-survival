        So you decided to lock up the warehouse. It's always nice to play it safe. Unfortunately, locking up the warehouse will not prevent the inevitable in this case. Remember those weird sounds you were hearing earlier? They're definitely now footsteps spreading around the warehouse. As you listen closely, you can hear a rival gang leader giving out orders under hushed tones. What's your plan of action now? You can call for backup or you can take the attack to them. The more you hear, the more it seems like you're outnumbered. Maybe it's for the best if you retreatâ€¦
